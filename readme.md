# BibTeX Deduplicator

A powerful GUI and command-line tool for detecting and removing duplicate entries from BibTeX (.bib) files. Perfect for researchers and academics who need to clean up their reference libraries.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Duplicate Detection**: Uses advanced similarity algorithms to find duplicates based on titles, authors, DOI, and publication year
- **Interactive GUI**: Visual interface for reviewing and selecting which duplicates to keep
- **Automatic Resolution**: Identical entries are automatically merged, keeping the best citation key
- **Flexible Similarity Threshold**: Adjustable sensitivity for duplicate detection (0.6 - 0.95)
- **Command Line Support**: Batch processing for automated workflows
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Preserves Original Formatting**: Maintains BibTeX entry structure and formatting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Application (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:
   - **Windows**: `BibTeX-Deduplicator-windows.exe`
   - **macOS**: `BibTeX-Deduplicator-macos`
   - **Linux**: `BibTeX-Deduplicator-linux`
3. Double-click to run - no Python installation required!

### Option 2: Run from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bibtex-deduplicator.git
cd bibtex-deduplicator

# Install Python dependencies (tkinter is usually included with Python)
# No additional dependencies required for basic functionality

# Run the application
python bib_deduplicator.py
```

## üìñ Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)

1. **Launch the application** by double-clicking the executable or running `python bib_deduplicator.py`
2. **Select your BibTeX file** using the "Browse" button
3. **Choose output location** (auto-generated by default)
4. **Adjust similarity threshold** in the Settings tab if needed (default: 0.80)
5. **Click "Start Analysis"** to begin duplicate detection
6. **Review duplicates** when prompted:
   - Select which entry to keep from each group
   - Use "Keep All in Group" to preserve all variants
   - Use "Skip Group" to ignore and keep all entries
7. **Save the cleaned file** automatically

### Command Line Mode

For automated processing or integration into scripts:

```bash
# Basic usage
./BibTeX-Deduplicator --cli -i input.bib -o output_clean.bib

# With custom similarity threshold
./BibTeX-Deduplicator --cli -i input.bib -o output_clean.bib -t 0.85

# Show help
./BibTeX-Deduplicator --help
```

#### Command Line Options

- `-i, --input`: Input BibTeX file (required)
- `-o, --output`: Output BibTeX file (required)
- `-t, --threshold`: Similarity threshold (0.6-0.95, default: 0.8)
- `--cli`: Run in command line mode
- `--help`: Show help message

## üîß How It Works

### Duplicate Detection Algorithm

1. **Parse BibTeX entries** and extract key information (title, authors, year, DOI)
2. **Fast DOI matching** - entries with identical DOIs are automatically grouped
3. **Similarity analysis** for entries without DOI matches:
   - Title similarity using sequence matching
   - Author similarity analysis
   - Year-based filtering for performance
4. **Smart resolution**:
   - Identical entries ‚Üí automatically keep the one with shortest citation key
   - Similar entries ‚Üí present to user for manual selection

### What Counts as Similar?

- **High similarity** (>threshold) in title AND same publication year
- **High similarity** (>threshold) in author list AND same publication year  
- **Identical DOI** (automatic match regardless of other fields)

## üìÅ File Structure

```
bibtex-deduplicator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bib_deduplicator.py      # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-deduplicator.py    # Build script for creating executables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                 # License file
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

If you want to create your own executable:

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Run the build script
python build-deduplicator.py

# Or build manually
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name BibTeX-Deduplicator bib_deduplicator.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Academic Researchers**: Clean up reference libraries before submission
- **Literature Reviews**: Merge bibliographies from multiple sources  
- **Reference Managers**: Import/export cleanup between tools
- **Collaborative Projects**: Deduplicate shared bibliography files
- **Database Migration**: Clean up references when switching tools

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Similarity Threshold Guidelines

- **0.95**: Very strict - only near-identical entries
- **0.85**: Recommended for most cases
- **0.80**: Default - good balance of precision and recall
- **0.70**: More lenient - catches more potential duplicates
- **0.60**: Very lenient - may flag false positives

### Performance Tips

- For large files (>1000 entries), consider using command line mode
- The tool automatically optimizes for speed with year-based filtering
- Processing time scales roughly with O(n¬≤) for worst-case scenarios

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit:

- **Bug reports** - Include sample BibTeX files if possible
- **Feature requests** - Describe your use case
- **Pull requests** - Follow existing code style
- **Documentation improvements**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No duplicates found" but I know there are duplicates**
- Try lowering the similarity threshold in Settings
- Check if entries have very different formatting
- Verify that titles/authors are properly formatted in BibTeX

**Application won't start on macOS**
- Right-click ‚Üí "Open" to bypass security restrictions
- Or run: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine BibTeX-Deduplicator-macos`

**Large files are slow**
- Use command line mode for better performance
- Consider splitting very large files (>5000 entries)

**Encoding errors**
- Ensure your BibTeX file is UTF-8 encoded
- Check for special characters in entries

### Getting Help

1. Check the [Issues](../../issues) page for similar problems
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Your operating system
   - Sample BibTeX entries (anonymized)
   - Steps to reproduce the problem

## üìä Statistics

After processing, you'll see:
- Original number of entries
- Number of duplicate groups found
- Final number of entries after deduplication
- Percentage reduction in file size

## üë®‚Äçüíª About the Author

This tool was developed by **Alex (Owen) Davies**, a PhD researcher at the Interactive AI CDT, University of Bristol. With a background in:

- **PhD Research** in Interactive AI (2021-Present)
- **MSc Data Science** from University of Bristol (Distinction, 2020-21)
- **MPhys Physics with Astronomy** from Durham University (2016-2020)
- **Industry Experience** developing Python pipelines for the Euclid space project
- **Freelance Photography** and creative technical projects

As a researcher who regularly works with large bibliographies and reference management, this tool was born from personal frustration with duplicate entries cluttering academic databases. The goal was to create something that actual researchers would want to use - fast, reliable, and intelligent enough to handle the messy reality of academic citations.
